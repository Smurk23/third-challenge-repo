# third-challenge-repo

In this challenege I was able to get a website to generate a randomized password by getting feed back from the user.

I used serial methods to do this including giving a promt to the user to find out how many characters should be used. Using confirm to ask if the user wanted lowercase,uppercase,special characters or numbers inlcuded in said password.

After taking in all user information I was able to randomize the outcomes and create a completely random and secure password.
